        <h1>About me</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Hi there, my name is <b>Iestyn Green</b>. I am currently in my second year at Liverpool Hope, studying Computer Science. I am currently employed at the Sugar and Dice board game cafe and in my free time I run the Liverpool Hope Film Society.
        I have got a strong passion for technology and enjoy programming in my spare time.
        So I have built this website to demonstrate my programming ability and to allow you to learn more about me.
        This website includes information about me such as: </p>
    <p>
        My Education- This will show you what grades I have earned as well as other skills I may have developed.
        </p>
    <p>
        My Experience- This will demonstrate where I have previously been employed and will include and useful skills I have garnered through working as well as details of what my previous jobs entailed.
        </p>
    <p>
        and as well I will include any projects I am currently working on, for example the Film Society at Hope.
    </p>
<p>

        I hope you will find this useful to learn more about me and why I may be a useful asset to your company.
