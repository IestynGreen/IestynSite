    <p>In October 2021 I decided to establish the Film Society at my university and I currently continue to run it as president.
        As a society we host a meeting once a week where we will meet up in a lecture theatre and watch a movie film together, then after we discuss the film together.
        Currently, we have 29 members signed up with on average 13 members attending each week and have over 100 followers on instagram.
    </p>
    <p>
        My role as president in the society is to organise the meetings, booking the lecture theatre, hosting surveys and polls, maintaining the society's
        social media's (instagram, facebook, email),
        public speaking and meeting/ introducing myself to new people, attending Student Union meetings and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Running the society has been a very fun project, and I have really enjoyed meeting lots of new people.
        I believe it has given me a lots of experience in organisation and leadership, and has given me the opportunity to meet lots of people that I otherwise wouldn't have met.
